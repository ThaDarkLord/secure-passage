# secure-passage


## Description

This project was designed to allow the user to generate a unique password containing anywhere from 8-128 characters. They have the ability to choose uppercase, lowercase, numbers and symbols. I learned that just being able to mimic certain activities doesn't equate to you knowing the knowldge. I will have to continue to study and apply the fundamentals of javascript.

## Usage

When the user clicks generate password they will be prompted to choose from 8-128 characters. Once selected they will be asked which characters they would like included in their password. Once all criteria is met they will be provided a unique password.
